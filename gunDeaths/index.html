<h1>Gun Deaths in the US 2000-2010</h1>

<h1>Conclusions</h1>
<p>While the rate of national firearm deaths remained stable during 2000â€“ 2010, there was significant variation at the state level.</p>
<p>Gun related deaths were twice as high in African Americans than Caucasians but decreased among Hispanics.</p>

<p>Efforts to identify state-specific best practices can contribute to changes in national firearm fatality rates that remain high. This calls for specific studies to identify the drivers of the state-specific trends followed by introducing tailored programmes that target specific racial and ethnic groups in specific states.</p>
