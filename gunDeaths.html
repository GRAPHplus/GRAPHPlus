#Gun Deaths in the US 2000-2010
```
- center: [39.0, -101.5]

```

Between 2000 and 2010, 335,609 people died from gun related deaths in the United States. Researchers looked at data from the Web-based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting System to identify the trends in race (Caucasian, African-American or other), ethnicity (Hispanic or non-Hispanic) and intent (homicide, suicide, undetermined or unintentional). Here is what they found.


#National Average
```

- zoom: 5
```

Nationally during this 11 year period, the risk of death by firearm was 10.21 per 100,000 people meaning approximately 10 people out of every 100,000 in the US died by a gun.

#Lowest and Highest

Deaths varied by state with the lowest number of deaths being 3.02 per 100,000 in Hawaii and the highest number of deaths being 18.62 per 100,000 in Louisiana. 


#States Higher than National Average

Overall 30 states and Washington DC had rates higher than the national average.




#Not Much Change

```

41 of the states didn’t change much from 2000-2010. 



# Death Rate by Race

The national average rate of death by gun for African Americans was 18.51 per 100,000 people and for Caucasians was 9.05 per 100,000. (Nationally, African Americans were almost twice more likely to die by a gun than Caucasians.)


# Death Rate by Ethnicity

The national average rate of death by gun for Hispanics was 7.13 per 100,000 people and for non-Hispanics was 10.13 per 100,000. (Nationally, non-Hispanics were more likely to die by a gun than Hispanics.)


# States with Gun Death Decreases

Seven states and Washington DC saw their rate of gun deaths decrease over this 11 year period, California, North Carolina, Arizona, Nevada, New York, Illinois, and Maryland. In those states fewer deaths of Hispanics and African-Americans drove the fall.

# Homicides and Suicides Nationally

Nationally the rates of firearm related deaths classified as homicides (4.1 per 100,000) and suicides (5.8 per 100,000) remained constant during this time but varied between states.

# Conclusions

While the rate of national firearm deaths remained stable during 2000– 2010, there was significant variation at the state level.

Gun related deaths were twice as high in African-Americans than Caucasians but decreased among Hispanics.

Efforts to identify state-specific best practices can contribute to changes in national firearm fatality rates that remain high. This calls for specific studies to identify the drivers of the state-specific trends followed by introducing tailored programmes that target specific racial and ethnic groups in specific states.

# Strength and LImitations of this Study

▪ This study uses the best available data of firearm mortality in the USA.

▪ It highlights the state-specific variations in firearm fatalities including fluctuation according to race, ethnicity and intent which was previously hidden behind a national gun mortality rate that stayed stable during this 11 year period.

▪ This is the first report that documents firearm fatality trends by ethnicity.

▪ Understanding the drivers that result in ethnic, racial and intent trends can help states identify programs to reduce death and injury due to firearms.

▪ It is possible that not all gun deaths have been reported, which impacts the results.

▪ The variation in firearm mortality may be a feature of cities and counties with varying crime rates, and we do not address the variation existing at such level.
